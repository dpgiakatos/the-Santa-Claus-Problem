<h1>(Trono) The Santa Claus problem</h1>
Develop an algorithm to simulate the following system: Santa Claus sleeps at the North Pole until awakened by either all of the nine reindeer, or by a group of three out of ten elves. He then performs one of two indivisible actions: If awakened by the group of reindeer, Santa harnesses them to a sleigh, delivers toys, and finally unharnesses the reindeer who then go on vacation. If awakened by a group of elves, Santa shows them into his office, consults with them on toy R&D, and finally shows them out so they can return to work constructing toys. A waiting group of reindeer must be served by Santa before a waiting group of elves. Since Santa's time is extremely valuable, marshaling the reindeer or elves into a group must not be done by Santa.
